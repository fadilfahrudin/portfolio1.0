						<h1>Hey Everyone!üëã</h1>

							<b> I'm Fadillah Fahrudin, as UI design and Front-End Developer.</b>{" "}
							Youth 25 years old born in Lampung. I graduated from the University of
							Pamulang majoring in Informatic of technic (2023).
						</p>
						<p>
							I have a solid experience in several programming languages such as HTML,
							CSS, JavaScript, and a little basic PHP language. I am also very familiar
							love with frameworks such as Bootstrap and React. In addition, I also
							understand basic concepts such as responsive design, UI design and also I
							can make a mobile application with React Native.
						</p>
						<p>
							First time I became interested in programming languages when I was in
							Junior High School and at that time I watched a movie titled{" "}
							<b> Who Am I</b> after this I was interested and wanted to be a hacker
							hehe.ü§£ So I started to find out how to learn programming language when I
							was a bachelor's degree student at the University of Pamulang (2017) I
							chose major in informatics of technic and the first language that I knew
							was C++ until the fourth semester I found a YouTube channel{" "}
							<a href='https://www.youtube.com/@sandhikagalihWPU' target='_blank'>
								Web Programming UNPAS
							</a>{" "}
							that provides education regarding basic languages such as HTML CSS PHP
							and Javascript.
						</p>
						<p>
							First project was at that time creating a static web portfolio using HTML
							CSS and javascript. and while studying in 2022, for the first time I
							worked in the web developer section to build a social website the Gerakan
							Infaq Nutrisi, starting from UI design using Figma and then slicing to
							code HTML, CSS, and Javascript. At the time I build this website, I use
							the Laravel framework. But this project has not been resumed until now
							from my office.
						</p>
						<p>
							My final undergraduate exams, I created an Android-based crowdfunding
							application using React Native. Previously, I wasn't very familiar with
							React, so I am looking to know until I found a BootCamp class in the{" "}
							<a href='https://buildwithangga.com/' target='_blank'>
								{" "}
								Build with Angga{" "}
							</a>
							about making an Android Food Market application using React Native as the
							Front-End and Laravel as the Back-End and I finished this class.
						</p>
						<p>
							I find out about React, read about documents, and always try it in my
							simple project. and I continue my study case to make Android Application
							for my final undergraduate exams and about six months I finished this
							project.ü¶æ‚öîÔ∏è

						<p>
							And I like this framework.
